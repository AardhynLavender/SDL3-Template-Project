# SDL3 Template Project

## Configuration

Download and build a local copy of **SDL3** following their [installation instructions](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/INSTALL.txt).

Make directories `./include`, and `./lib` in the root of this repository.

I'm not a fan of linking with system installations of libraries and frameworks.
Copy the contents of `build/include` from your local **SDL3** repository into `./include`;

### MacOS

Copy `build/libSDL3.dylib` into `./lib`

### Windows
